# Hello and welcome to my profile 👋
My name is Caleb and I am taking a computer science class at raising arrows accadamy where I am learnig about code and computing systems.

As of right now  I am taking computer science, history, spanish, and biology at raising arrows accadamy and geometry and language arts at home.

I enjoy learning random knowledge most of which is absolutely useless unless you want to make a trivia, hanging out with friends from school and church, and going to church on sundays and wednesdays.
